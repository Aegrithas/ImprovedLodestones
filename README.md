# Improved Lodestones

This is a minecraft fabric mod that makes a few changes to make lodestones and compasses more immersive.

* Lodestones now require an iron ingot rather than a netherite ingot. This should encourage most people to use lodestones and compasses rather than coordinates and F3.
* Unbound compasses now point north rather than world spawn. This should encourage more people to use cardinal directions (e.g., "I went southeast" rather than "I went that way").
* Lodestones can be given a name via an interface similar to a sign's; these names are unique in the dimension, and are displayed in the tooltip of any compasses bound to named lodestones.
  * Because names are unique, a compasses can be trusted to a certain extent; however, anyone can edit a lodestone's name, so there's still room for mischief.
* Compasses bound to a lodestone in a different dimension from the player holding them will say their destination dimension in the tooltip: a quality of life bonus I made so that you don't have to perform a process of elimination to find the correct dimension (especially helpful when paired with mods that add more dimensions).
